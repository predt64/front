### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- Vue 3
- Nuxt 3/4
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Pinia
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Vuetify classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.

Info about project:

A web application for learning English through TV series subtitles. Users upload subtitle files (SRT/VTT), view them with timestamps, and click on phrases to get AI-powered grammar analysis, translations, and slang explanations (via Urban Dictionary). The app processes subtitles in the background for instant analysis during viewing, prioritizing user experience with minimal delays.

ПРАВИЛА:
Отвечай коротко и по делу
Чем меньше кода - тем лучше.
Не переходи к умозаключениям сразу, сомевайся в своих ответах. You should start the reasoning paragraph with lots of uncertainty and slowly gain confidence as you think about the item more
